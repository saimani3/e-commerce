    <b>Traditional food delivery services</b>
<p className="textline">Traditional food delivery services have long been a part of the food industry, with local restaurants and fast-food chains offering home delivery or takeout options.[18] These services often rely on in-house or third-party delivery drivers who transport prepared meals directly from the restaurant to the customer. Dominos, Pizza Hut, and Papa John's are examples of established global brands that have been offering delivery services for decades.[19]

 <b>Restaurant-controlled</b>
 <p className="textline">In restaurant-controlled online food ordering, the restaurants create their own website and app, or choose to hire a delivery vendor. If they choose to create their own website, they make sure to obtain software that manages the orders efficiently, meaning it has the capability to manage different orders at once.[4] When they hire a vendor, the restaurant pays for a monthly fee or percentage-based fees. The vendor covers the developmental costs.[4]

A customer can choose to have the food delivered or for pick-up/take-away.[4] The process consists of a customer choosing the restaurant of their choice, scanning the menu items, choosing an item, and finally choosing for pick-up or delivery.[12] Payment is then administered by paying with a credit card or debit card through the app or website or in cash at the restaurant when going to pickup.[4] The website and app inform the customer of the food quality, duration of food preparation, and when the food is ready for pick-up or the amount of time it will take for delivery.[12] Papa John's is one of the restaurants that created their own Papa John's system, website, and app, and do their own delivery.[20] In 2010, they redesigned their website and launched mobile apps for iPhones, iPads, iPods, Androids Phones, Blackberrys, and Windows Phones.[21]

The preexisting delivery infrastructure of these franchises paired with the online ordering system. In 2010, Papa John's International announced that its online sales had exceeded $2 billion.[20]

<b>Independent websites</b>
<p className="textline">In this case, a person cooks and offers meals or kits via their website, which are then directly sent to consumers.[5] The consumer chooses which meal and how many meals they want sent to their office or home, and pays depending on the meals or the program they are interested in. People choose to order meals from other people for different reasons: not wanting or having time to cook, wanting to eat home-cooked meals, or to lose weight by eating healthy foods. Examples of this type of service include DineWise, NutriSystem, Chef's Diet, etc.[5]

<b>Food cooperatives</b>
<p className="textline"> Some food cooperatives like Macomb Co-op[22] allow members to place orders of locally grown and/or produced food online and pick up and pay for their orders at a central location.[23]

<b>Delivery platforms</b>
<p className="textline">See also: Food delivery
The riders and drivers for nearly all independent restaurant delivery app services are independent contractors, having the flexibility to choose when they work.[24] In Australia, specifically riders for the food app of Foodora, consider themselves employees because they sometimes work full time hours, are required to wear uniforms, and run shift system.[24]

However, food delivery riders and drivers usually do not receive any insurance coverage, protective gear, or sick pay as independent contractors,[25] which have led to some asking for improved safety standards.[26] In response, Deliveroo gave riders a helmet with a GoPro camera to record any problems they may face, specifically with criminals. The riders have the opportunity to raise safety concerns about delivery areas in the app.[25]

<b>Meal-Kit delivery services</b>
<p className="textline">Another segment within the global food delivery industry is meal-kit delivery services, which provide customers with pre-portioned ingredients and recipes to prepare meals at home. Meal-kit delivery services such as Blue Apron, HelloFresh, and Sun Basket have gained popularity, particularly among health-conscious consumers and those with busy lifestyles. These services offer the convenience of food delivery combined with the experience of home cooking, catering to a growing demand for healthy and personalized meal options.[27][28]
